      description: "SILK REINE Mulberry Silk-Lined Knitted Beanie (Black) Say goodbye to beanies that cause bad hair days. There’s no need to worry about knots or frizz when wearing our stylish silk-lined beanie hat — designed to eliminate hat hair and keep your locks healthy! Crafted from knitted acrylic for a warm and cozy feel, the interior of this hat is lined with breathable, temperature-regulating silk. Wear this stylish slouch beanie all day long and it won’t irritate the scalp thanks to its hypoallergenic properties. You can even use it as a silk bonnet while you sleep if you want to protect your hair from drying cotton pillowcases. Unlike standard satin-lined beanies, this accessory is made with mulberry silk: the highest quality silk available on the market. Its supremely soft texture prevents friction against your scalp and strands — aiding in the prevention of hair loss and breakage. Silk also won’t strip away any moisture, allowing your flowing locks to retain their healthy, natural shine. Care instructions: hand-washing and leaving this accessory to air dry is recommended. The materials are resistant to fading and shrinkage.",

        'MULBERRY SILK LINING: Unlike standard satin beanies, our lined slouch beanie incorporates Mulberry silk for maximum quality and long-lasting wear. The finest silk available, this material has a supremely soft texture and is hypoallergenic to prevent any scalp irritation.',
        'HELPS HAIR MAINTAIN SHINE: Materials like cotton strip away moisture from your strands, leading to dry and damaged locks. Silk headwear can be worn all day long (or while you sleep as a bonnet), as it doesn’t absorb the hair’s natural oils and therefore retains a healthy shine.',
        'PREVENTS KNOTS & FRIZZ: Keep your curls under control and locks frizz-free with this lined slouchy beanie for women. There is no need to worry about knots, tangles, or breakage, as silk is extremely smooth and does not cause friction. It may also aid in the prevention of hair loss.',
        'ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL: Carefully crafted from knitted acrylic, this hat is lined with stretchy elastic to offer maximum comfort without falling off easily. In order to maintain its pristine quality, we advise only hand-washing your lined beanie and letting it air dry to avoid shrinkage and fading.'
